I cannot guarantee that this program is safe for the keyboard, use it at your own risk.


Dotnet Core library to control the keyboard + very simple avalonia UI to set the colors on it.
Tested on windows 10 and arch linux, should work fine but takes very long to set the keyboard due to hardware limitations.
I wrote this mostly to play around with avalonia and dotnetcore on linux.

Feel free to submit pull requests.

Thanks to https://github.com/thanks4opensource/NotLinuxAjazzAK33RGB , which i consulted for the key mappings and packets.
